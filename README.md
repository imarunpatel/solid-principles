# S.O.L.I.D Principles with Java Examples

**Single responsibility Principle** 
- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Open/Closed Principle** 
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle** 
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Interface Segregation Principle** 
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Create specific interfaces for specific clients.

**Dependency inversion Principle** 
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
